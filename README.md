## Logbook

All actions are recorded in the Home Assistant logbook:

- User name (via trigger.context.user_id)  
- Light entity  
- Action (ON / OFF)  
- Trigger source: NFC  

Ideal for:
- Multi-user environments  
- Auditing and traceability  
- Debugging

## iOS Notes

Due to iOS system restrictions:

- The iPhone must be unlocked (Face ID / Touch ID is sufficient)  
- No additional confirmation is required  
- iOS briefly shows a system banner (“NFC tag detected”)  
- NFC scans are not possible while the device is locked  

These limitations are enforced by iOS and cannot be bypassed by Home Assistant.

---

## Android Notes

- NFC scans may work without unlocking (device-dependent)  
- In many cases, no confirmation dialog  
- Very fast trigger response  

---

## Security

The blueprint supports:

- User identification via trigger.context.user_id  
- Person mapping in Home Assistant  

Automations can be extended to allow only specific users or devices.

---

## Possible Extensions

The blueprint can easily be extended with:

- User whitelist  
- Day/Night brightness or color  
- Multiple lights per tag  
- Per-user statistics or counters  
- Notifications
